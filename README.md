# Ascii Tetris in Python by Sucram314

So I wanted to practice Perfect Clears but I couldn't find a way to start in the middle of a bag in jstris or tetrio so I remade Tetris in Python. And it's completely ASCII graphics as well. I might add an AI later. There will probably be some more changes to make it more user friendly soon. Sorry if the code is hard to read lol

12. You're done!!  

## How to Play:  
Random 4 block shapes will spawn at the top and you have to control where they will be placed with movement left and right and with rotation. Clear lines on the board by filling an entire line with blocks. Try not to stack too high because if you reach the top, you lose! You can also hold one piece and use it for later. Press r to restart.  

For people who know what this is: You can use function keys to start in the middle of 7-bags and practice perfect clears!
