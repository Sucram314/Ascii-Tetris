# Ascii Tetris in Python by Sucram314

So I wanted to practice Perfect Clears but I couldn't find a way to start in the middle of a bag in jstris or tetrio so I remade Tetris in Python. And it's completely ASCII graphics as well. I might add an AI later. Sorry if the code is hard to read lol

Idk if it works on different operating systems other than windows so please tell me and I can make some changes hopfully...

## Installation:  
1. Download Ascii-Tetris as zip  
2. Extract all  
3. Open "Options.txt"  
4. Set your controls, preferred handling, etc.  
5. **Save**  
6. Exit  
7. Run "Ascii Tetris!.exe"  
8. If your computer blocks it for whatever reason, bypass it (im not trying to destroy your computer don't worry)
   On windows it would say "Windows protected your PC". You can press more details and press run anyway to bypass it. It will never pop up again
   Idk about other operating systems... There's probably a way to bypass the antivirus...
   
9. You are done!  

Note: it doesn't work, you probably messed something up in the options file... In that case, you should run "Reset.exe" to reset the options file.  

## How to Play:  
Random 4 block shapes will spawn at the top and you have to control where they will be placed with movement left and right and with rotation. Clear lines on the board by filling an entire line with blocks. Try not to stack too high because if you reach the top, you lose! You can also hold one piece and use it for later. Press r to restart.  

For people who know what this is: You can use function keys to start in the middle of 7-bags and practice perfect clears!
